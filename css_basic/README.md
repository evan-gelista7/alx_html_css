Task 1. Positioning : I used CSS Flexbox to get a layout that looks organized and clean
Task 2. Responsive web design: I added an attribute on the index.html file so that the layout I created will degrade nicely as I resize the window.
Task 2. Some more styling: I added some stylings to make it a bit unique
